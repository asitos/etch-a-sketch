## my little etch-a-sketch

this is a little project i made while learning to code. it's a simple, browser-based etch-a-sketch, a digital version of the classic toy. you can draw on the screen just by moving your mouse.

i built this as part of my journey through the odin project, and it was a great way to practice my skills in a small front-end project and to explore javascript dom manipulation and responsive design.

## how to play:

it's super simple. just move your mouse over the grid on the screen, and you'll see a trail appear. it's like drawing with a magic pen!
